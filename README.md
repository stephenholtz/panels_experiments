This repository has all of the code to make/test files for the panels for stimulus display../ functions in te main file are general utilities./configs - contains arena configuration files that are needed for mapping the data in a pattern file to the display arena../patterns - contains funcitons for making patterns./position_functions - contains functions for making position_functions./protocols - contains a folder for each tethered flight experiment, within each experiment's folder is a copy of all files that are on the SD card when an experiment is run (SD_card_contents). There is a metadata file that will be saved with each experiment, and an m file with the same name as the directory that has all of the different conditions for that experiment.Each protocol folder location is passed to run_panels_experiment (in panels_experiment_utilities) to start the experiment, which will take some general settings from panels_experiment_instance (also in panels_experiment_utlitities)../imaging_protocols - contains a folder for each imaging experiment, similar to the tethered flight protocols except for some of the fields that the m file will return. This folder is also passed to a function run_panels_imaging_experiment, which is panels_imaging_experiment_utilities (a less structured version of the tethered flight version
